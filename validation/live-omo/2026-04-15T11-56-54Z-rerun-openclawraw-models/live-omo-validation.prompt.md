You are executing one bounded worker task for OpenClaw.
Do not decide follow-up workflow. Only complete the assigned task and write the declared artifacts.

Task ID: live-omo-validation
Working directory: /home/molt/clawd/.tmp/openclaw-fabric-live-sandbox-20260415-065654

Goal:
Read inputs/source.txt. Write artifacts/live-handoff.md with what was done, what remains unresolved, and verification performed. Write artifacts/live-result.json matching the declared WorkerResult contract with status succeeded if both artifacts are written.

Inputs:
- /home/molt/clawd/.tmp/openclaw-fabric-live-sandbox-20260415-065654/inputs/source.txt

Required artifacts:
- Human handoff markdown: /home/molt/clawd/.tmp/openclaw-fabric-live-sandbox-20260415-065654/artifacts/live-handoff.md
- Machine result json: /home/molt/clawd/.tmp/openclaw-fabric-live-sandbox-20260415-065654/artifacts/live-result.json

Stop condition:
Both declared artifacts exist and the result JSON validates.

Verification expectations:
- handoff artifact exists
- result artifact conforms to worker-result.schema.json shape

Status rules:
- succeeded: stop condition met and required artifacts written
- blocked: missing input, credential, clarification, or dependency
- failed: crash, contract violation, or verification failure

Result JSON contract:
{
  "taskId": "live-omo-validation",
  "status": "succeeded | blocked | failed",
  "summary": "short plain summary",
  "artifacts": {
    "handoff": "/home/molt/clawd/.tmp/openclaw-fabric-live-sandbox-20260415-065654/artifacts/live-handoff.md",
    "result": "/home/molt/clawd/.tmp/openclaw-fabric-live-sandbox-20260415-065654/artifacts/live-result.json"
  },
  "nextStep": "optional",
  "resumeFrom": "/home/molt/clawd/.tmp/openclaw-fabric-live-sandbox-20260415-065654/artifacts/live-handoff.md",
  "errors": [],
  "verification": [
    "handoff artifact exists",
    "result artifact conforms to worker-result.schema.json shape"
  ]
}

Handoff markdown must include:
- what you were asked to do
- what you actually did
- what remains unresolved
- smallest next step
- verification performed

If you cannot proceed, still write both artifacts and set status to blocked or failed.
